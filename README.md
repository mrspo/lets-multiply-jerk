# Let's Multiply, Jerk
I created this to help one of my kids with their multiplication tables when all other methods were unsuccessful. I added some fun with insulting when quitting, praising when you answer correctly, and overall general snarkiness and *gasp!* curse words. List of insults and compliments were borrowed from the internet somewhere.

### How to use:
1. Open Powershell, navigate to the location of the script, and run:
```
.\LetsMultiply.ps1
```

2. Accept the 'ready to get started' prompt
```
Let's multiply, jerk
Are you ready? If you say no, I will insult you and the program will close in 5 seconds.
[y | yes | si]

Good answer! Let's rock this shit!
```

3. Accept the prompt to view the instructions:
```
Do you want the instructions?
[y | yes | si]

* When you are presented a problem, please type the answer and hit Enter.
* If correct, you will be given a new problem.
* If incorrect, you'll be given the same problem again until you enter a correct answer.

* To quit, answer any problem with 'QUIT'. You'll probably be insulted tho.
```
4. To quit:
```
Please answer the following question: 7 x 6 = __
[quit | stop | exit]

Okay, let's just quit everything we start, QUITTER :eyeroll:
